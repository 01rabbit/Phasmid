# Phasmid Threat Model

## Scope

Phasmid is a field-evaluation prototype for local-only coercion-aware storage. It protects payloads in `vault.bin` with password-based cryptographic recovery, a camera-matched physical object cue, a local access key, and authenticated encryption.

It is not a substitute for audited full-disk encryption, hardware-backed key storage, classified-data handling procedures, or a complete answer to compelled disclosure.

A structured STRIDE analysis mapping this model to the six threat categories is in
`docs/THREAT_ANALYSIS_STRIDE.md`.

## In-Scope Adversaries

| Adversary | Capability | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical captor** | Physical possession of device at rest (powered off or locked) | Recover vault payload or confirm existence of restricted state |
| **Local passive observer** | Can view screen, read shell history, inspect filesystem without active access | Extract operational context, identify Phasmid installation, learn slot count or mode |
| **Local active attacker** | OS-level access to project directory and state directory | Copy `vault.bin` and state for offline cracking; replace access key; tamper with audit log |
| **Remote attacker (local-network)** | Network access to the WebUI over localhost or USB gadget interface | Replay web token; brute-force passphrase via WebUI; exploit WebUI endpoint |
| **Coercing authority** | Legal or physical coercion of operator | Compel disclosure of normal or restricted passphrase; compel confirmation of vault contents |

---

## Out-of-Scope Adversaries

| Adversary | Reason for Exclusion |
|---|---|
| **Compromised host kernel or hypervisor** | Assumed trusted; kernel-level access defeats all software controls |
| **Hardware implant or side-channel attacker** | Beyond prototype scope; requires hardware security module or certified enclave |
| **Remote attacker over untrusted network** | WebUI is designed for localhost / USB gadget only; external exposure is an operational misconfiguration |
| **Supply-chain attacker** | Package integrity is out of scope for this prototype; see `SH-22` (dependency pinning) |
| **Cryptographic breaks against AES-GCM or Argon2id** | Assumed computationally secure under current parameters |

## Trust Assumptions

> **Note:** This section was previously titled "Assumptions" (anchor `#assumptions`). The old anchor is preserved via this note.

- The host operating system account is trusted while Phasmid is running.
- Attackers may obtain a copy of `vault.bin`.
- Attackers may observe or copy files in the project directory if OS permissions are weak.
- The Web UI is intended for local use through `127.0.0.1` or USB gadget networking.
- Camera matching is an operational gate, not a cryptographic biometric factor.
- Experimental object-model output, if enabled, is an operational cue only and must never influence key derivation or container layout.
- Device capture is realistic, so rendered UI and documentation should avoid explaining the internal disclosure model during normal use.
- The device hardware (e.g., CPU serial, hardware revision) is relatively static and can be used as a source of device-binding entropy.
- Field Mode reduces normal information exposure, but it is not a security boundary.
- Hidden restricted routes reduce casual exposure, but they are not security boundaries.
- Hidden routes are not access control by themselves; server-side token checks, restricted confirmation, and typed confirmation remain required.

---

## Assets

- Payload bytes and encrypted payload metadata.
- Separation between visible recovery outcomes and protected local state.
- Encrypted camera reference state blob in the configured state directory.
- Local vault access key in the configured state directory.
- Panic token in the configured state directory.
- Web UI mutation token created at process start or supplied through `PHASMID_WEB_TOKEN`.
- Browser-visible surfaces such as rendered HTML, console output, response headers, filenames, and cached pages.
- CLI output, shell history, application stdout/stderr, and systemd logs.
- camera overlay text and Maintenance diagnostics output.
- Source identity, notes, evidence metadata, temporary field data, and local operational context.

---

## Attack Surfaces

> **Note:** This section was previously titled "Capture-Visible Surfaces" (anchor `#capture-visible-surfaces`). The old anchor is preserved via this note.

Capture-visible surfaces include the WebUI, rendered HTML, browser history, browser cache, JavaScript console, response headers, download filenames, CLI output, shell history, systemd stdout/stderr, audit logs, state-directory filenames, screenshots, and documentation copied to the device.

These surfaces should not reveal the internal disclosure model, internal trial order, slot purpose, restricted recovery side effects, or the existence of an alternate protected state.

### WebUI Surface

- HTTP endpoints served on `127.0.0.1` (default) or a configured bind address.
- Mutation endpoints require `X-Phasmid-Token`; restricted action endpoints additionally require a live restricted confirmation session.
- Response headers, `Content-Disposition` filename, and HTTP status codes are normalized to avoid leaking slot or mode information.

### CLI Surface

- Passphrase arguments are not passed on the command line; the TUI reads them interactively.
- Shell history and terminal scrollback may retain operation output.
- The Doctor page warns when shell history is active.

### State Directory Surface

- `access.bin`, `store.bin`, `lock.bin` — fixed filenames recognizable to an informed examiner.
- The ORB state blob (`store.bin`) encrypts reference templates under AES-GCM; raw templates are not stored.

### Filesystem and Log Surface

- `vault.bin` contains no plaintext header or format marker (v3 format).
- Optional audit log (`events.log`) records operation type, timestamp, and length only — not passwords, payload bytes, or plaintext filenames.

---

### TS-01: Vault Copy + Offline Cracking

**Tags:** T, Di

**Scenario:** Attacker copies `vault.bin` from captured or accessible device and attempts offline passphrase brute-force.

**Mitigation:** Local access key is mixed into Argon2id derivation; `vault.bin` alone is insufficient. Default Argon2id parameters (`memory_cost=32768`, `iterations=2`, `lanes=1`) are tuned to impose meaningful cost on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W class hardware. Each slot uses a fresh random salt and nonce.

---

### TS-02: State Directory Copy

**Tags:** T, Di

**Scenario:** Attacker copies both `vault.bin` and the state directory (including `access.bin`), removing the access-key separation benefit.

**Mitigation:** State directory should be on encrypted storage (separate from `vault.bin` where operationally feasible). `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET_FILE` or `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET_PROMPT=1` adds a third factor requiring knowledge of an external value.

**Residual risk:** If `vault.bin`, state directory, and external key material are all on one medium, separation benefits are eliminated.

---

### TS-03: Web Token Replay

**Tags:** S, I

**Scenario:** Attacker observes or captures `X-Phasmid-Token` from a local session and replays it to perform vault operations.

**Mitigation:** Token is per-process; rotation available via restricted action endpoint. WebUI binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, limiting token exposure to the local session.

**Residual risk:** Token is valid for the process lifetime; a compromised local session can replay it until process restart or explicit rotation.

---

### TS-04: Restricted Session Fixation or Replay

**Tags:** S, E

**Scenario:** Attacker who knows the restricted session cookie value replays it to access restricted action endpoints without re-confirmation.

**Mitigation:** Cookie is `HttpOnly`, short TTL (120 s default), bound to client IP, and validated server-side against an in-memory session store (not a static value). Restricted actions additionally require typed confirmation phrases.

**Residual risk:** Session state is in-process and clears on restart; no persistent invalidation mechanism.

---

### TS-05: Vault Ciphertext Tampering

**Tags:** T

**Scenario:** Attacker with filesystem access modifies bytes in `vault.bin` to corrupt or inject data.

**Mitigation:** Each slot uses AES-GCM with per-record AAD `phasmid-record-v3:<mode>:<role>:<size>`. Bit flips produce `InvalidTag`; the slot returns `(None, None)` instead of modified plaintext.

---

### TS-06: Access Key Replacement

**Tags:** T, E

**Scenario:** Attacker replaces `.state/access.bin` with a known value to enable brute-force with a controlled key.

**Mitigation:** Without the original `access.bin`, the Argon2id-derived AES-GCM key differs and decryption fails. State directory should be mode `0700` on encrypted storage.

**Residual risk:** An attacker who replaces `access.bin` before re-provisioning may introduce a known key if the operator re-stores data.

---

### TS-07: Audit Log Truncation or Deletion

**Tags:** R, T

**Scenario:** Attacker with filesystem access truncates or deletes `events.log` to erase evidence of operations.

**Mitigation:** Log integrity verification uses HMAC-SHA-256 chaining; gaps or hash mismatches are reported. Audit logging is opt-in (`PHASMID_AUDIT=1`).

**Residual risk:** Tampering is detectable after the fact but not preventable. Off-device log shipping is out of scope.

---

### TS-08: Response Header / Filename Leakage

**Tags:** I, Di, De

**Scenario:** HTTP response headers or `Content-Disposition` filename reveal slot labels, restricted action outcomes, or stored filenames to an observer.

**Mitigation:** `create_file_response()` always returns `retrieved_payload.bin` regardless of original filename. `purge_applied` flag is not exposed in any response header. Security headers include `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and a `Content-Security-Policy` with `frame-ancestors 'none'`. All responses include `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache`.

---

### TS-09: Browser Cache Leakage

**Tags:** Di, De

**Scenario:** Cached browser responses reveal payload content, filenames, or slot information to a later visitor.

**Mitigation:** All responses include `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache` and `Pragma: no-cache`.

**Residual risk:** Browser behavior varies; some browsers or proxies may not honor cache headers in all circumstances.

---

### TS-10: CLI Output or Shell History Leakage

**Tags:** Di, Id

**Scenario:** Shell history or terminal scrollback records passphrase arguments or operation results, exposing operational context.

**Mitigation:** TUI reads passphrases interactively; they are not passed as CLI arguments. Doctor page warns when shell history is active. Field Mode suppresses diagnostic detail until restricted confirmation is active.

---

### TS-11: Metadata Leakage in Stored Files

**Tags:** Di, Id, Li

**Scenario:** Stored files (JPEG, Office, PDF) contain embedded metadata (EXIF, authorship, location) that reveals source identity or operational context.

**Mitigation:** Store flow warns on metadata risk detection; best-effort scrubbing is available for supported file types. Unsupported types fail safely.

**Residual risk:** Metadata checks are best-effort. They can miss embedded identifiers, thumbnails, histories, and application-specific fields.

---

### TS-12: Repeated Access Failure / Lockout Bypass

**Tags:** D

**Scenario:** Attacker submits repeated incorrect passwords to exhaust the attempt counter, or restarts the process to reset the in-memory limiter.

**Mitigation:** `AttemptLimiter` applies per-client lockout after configurable failure threshold (`PHASMID_ACCESS_MAX_FAILURES`, default 5) for a configurable period (`PHASMID_ACCESS_LOCKOUT_SECONDS`, default 60 s). WebUI rate limiter (`enforce_rate_limit()`) limits 20 requests/60 s per client; exceeded rate returns HTTP 429.

**Residual risk:** In-process limiters reset on restart. Process-level restart clears the counter; this does not stop offline guessing against copied data.

---

### TS-13: Timing Side-Channel on Recovery Path

**Tags:** I, De

**Scenario:** Adversary with kernel-level or process-level tracing distinguishes the RESTRICTED recovery path from the FAILED path by observing timing differences (RESTRICTED path includes additional filesystem writes).

**Mitigation:** Argon2id KDF cost dominates end-to-end latency. NORMAL and RESTRICTED paths share the same HTTP response structure, `Content-Disposition` filename (`retrieved_payload.bin`), and media type. `purge_applied` flag does not appear in any response.

**Residual risk (unmitigated for kernel-level tracing):** The additional filesystem write on the RESTRICTED path is measurable with kernel-level process instrumentation. This difference cannot be eliminated without removing the local-state update itself. An adversary with such access is outside the in-scope adversary model.

---

### TS-14: Secure Deletion Failure on Flash Media

**Tags:** Di

**Scenario:** Deleted or overwritten payload bytes are retained in flash media wear-leveling sectors, SSD remapped blocks, backups, or filesystem journals, and recovered after device seizure.

**Mitigation (unmitigated):** Secure deletion of flash media is not reliably achievable through software alone. Key-material destruction (wiping `access.bin` or the LUKS container) renders retained ciphertext unrecoverable without the key. The seizure review checklist covers this risk.

**Claim boundary:** Brick and restricted-clear paths are logical access-destruction mechanisms. They are not physical media sanitization and must not be described as guaranteed secure deletion.

**Residual risk:** Physical recovery of flash chips may yield retained data. This threat is in-scope for awareness but not mitigated by Phasmid software controls alone.

---

### TS-15: State Directory Filename Detectability

**Tags:** De, Id

**Scenario:** Files named `access.bin`, `store.bin`, `lock.bin` in the state directory reveal to an examiner that a Phasmid-style installation is or was present.

**Mitigation:** Field Mode and LUKS layer reduce casual exposure. The seizure review checklist covers state directory inspection. The v3 vault format avoids a plaintext format marker in `vault.bin`.

**Residual risk:** File names are fixed by the current format version and are recognizable to an informed examiner.

---

### TS-16: Object Cue Spoofing

**Tags:** S

**Scenario:** Attacker who knows the reference object presents it to the camera to satisfy the object cue gate without authorization.

**Mitigation:** Object matching is an operational access cue, not cryptographic material. The vault requires the correct passphrase in addition to the object match. The cue is a layered operational control, not a single authentication factor.

---

### TS-17: Experimental Object Model Misclassification

**Tags:** S, D, Di

**Scenario:** A lightweight local object model returns an overconfident result under low light, blur, printed spoof, partial occlusion, or poor camera quality.

**Mitigation:** The model path is disabled by default, bounded by frame and time limits, and combined with neutral policy rather than trusted directly. ORB remains the baseline path unless target-hardware validation proves otherwise.

**Residual risk:** False accepts, false rejects, timing differences, and operator retry pressure remain possible until Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W validation is complete.

---

### TS-18: Coerced Disclosure

**Tags:** Di, U

**Scenario:** Operator is compelled by legal or physical coercion to reveal passphrase, confirm vault contents, or hand over device.

**Mitigation:** Restricted recovery path provides a plausible-deniability operational option (design intent). Protected entries use distinct normal and restricted passphrases sharing the same object cue. `PHASMID_PURGE_CONFIRMATION=1` requires explicit confirmation before irreversible local-state updates.

**Residual risk (partially unmitigated):** Phasmid does not claim to defeat compelled disclosure. The design provides operational friction and deniability tooling, not a legal or physical guarantee. See `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` Non-Claims section.

---

## Non-Goals

Phasmid explicitly does not aim to provide:

- **Certified cryptographic module compliance** (FIPS 140, Common Criteria) — Phasmid is a prototype; cryptographic primitives are standard but not validated.
- **Protection against a compromised host OS or kernel** — A trusted host is a foundational assumption.
- **Hardware-backed key storage or secure enclave isolation** — Key material resides in the filesystem under OS access controls.
- **Guaranteed resistance to compelled disclosure** — Restricted recovery provides operational deniability tooling, not a legal defense.
- **Reliable secure deletion on flash media** — Wear leveling and journaling prevent software-only guarantees.
- **Full audit trail by default** — Audit logging is opt-in to minimize local metadata; it is not tamper-proof against filesystem access.
- **Multi-user access control** — Phasmid is designed for single-operator local use.
- **Remote or network-accessible deployment** — WebUI is designed for localhost or USB gadget; remote deployment is a misconfiguration.
- **Protection against supply-chain compromise of dependencies** — Package integrity is operational responsibility; see `SH-22`.

---

## Current Defenses

- New stores use JES v3 records: random per-record Argon2id salt, random per-record AES-GCM nonce, no plaintext magic/header, and AEAD-authenticated encrypted metadata.
- Startup self-tests check local AES-GCM, HMAC-SHA-256, and random byte generation behavior before normal CLI/WebUI operation.
- The local access key is mixed into Argon2id by default, so copying `vault.bin` alone is insufficient for recovery.
- Hardware-specific identifiers (e.g., CPU serial, revision) are incorporated into the KDF derivation pipeline, providing basic device-binding for the vault container.
- Protected entries can be stored with normal access and restricted recovery passwords that share the same object cue.
- Store flows reject empty, duplicate, short, or highly repetitive passphrases to reduce accidental weak input.
- `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET_FILE`, `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET`, or `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET_PROMPT=1` can add an external value to Argon2id derivation. Data stored with any of these values requires the same value for retrieval.
- Default Argon2id parameters are tuned for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W class hardware: `memory_cost=32768`, `iterations=2`, `lanes=1`.
- Restricted recovery behavior and explicit restricted actions can update unmatched local state. These paths can cause irreversible data loss.
- Reference keys are stored together in a single AES-GCM encrypted ORB state blob under the configured state directory, not as raw reference photos or semantic per-entry template filenames.
- Image-key matching requires stable results across a short frame window rather than accepting a single-frame match.
- Web mutation endpoints require `X-Phasmid-Token`, apply a simple per-client rate limit, and enforce upload size limits.
- Access recovery flows count repeated local failures and apply a bounded temporary lockout. WebUI limiting is process-local; CLI limiting is stored in local state.
- Web responses include no-store cache headers, frame denial, MIME-sniffing protection, no-referrer policy, constrained browser permissions, and a local-only content security policy. These reduce browser residue and common Web embedding risks but do not make the WebUI safe for untrusted networks.
- Sensitive Web actions require a fresh restricted confirmation session in addition to the Web token. Restricted action pages and entry maintenance details are withheld until that confirmation is active.
- The Web server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- **Inactivity Auto-Kill**: When managed via the TUI, the WebUI server is
  automatically terminated after 10 minutes of operator inactivity to minimize
  exposure time and return the system to a stealth state.
- **Exposure Visualization**: The TUI Home Screen displays a high-visibility
  warning banner while the WebUI port is open, preventing accidental long-term
  exposure.
- Audit logging is disabled by default. If `PHASMID_AUDIT=1` is set, security-relevant operations append minimal versioned JSONL records to the state directory's event log without recording passwords, payload bytes, plaintext filenames, or internal slot labels. New records include local integrity fields for review.
- Field Mode (`PHASMID_FIELD_MODE=1`) hides Maintenance paths, audit export, token rotation, and detailed diagnostics until restricted confirmation is active.
- Store includes a local metadata risk check and limited best-effort metadata reduction for supported file types.
- Documentation includes seizure review, source-safe storage separation, field testing, and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W appliance deployment guidance.

---

## Residual Risks

- A compromised host can read passwords, process memory, camera frames, Web tokens, and decrypted output.
- ORB feature templates are not high-entropy cryptographic material. If the local state lock key is copied with the state blob, the local template encryption does not protect them.
- If the local access key is copied with `vault.bin`, the local access-key protection does not raise attacker cost.
- If `vault.bin`, the configured state directory, and external key material are carried together on one medium, separation benefits are reduced.
- Secure deletion is best-effort only. SSD wear leveling, backups, snapshots, and journaling filesystems may retain previous data.
- Startup self-tests detect some local primitive failures but are not cryptographic certification and do not prove the host is uncompromised.
- On flash media, recovery resistance depends primarily on key-material destruction or removal, not overwrite guarantees.
- The v3 format avoids a plaintext format marker, but surrounding tool files can still reveal that a Phasmid-style container may be in use.
- Dual password slots duplicate encrypted payload material within the selected internal storage span. This improves operational control but reduces maximum payload size.
- Multi-object cues and visual sequence cues can increase ambiguity risk and operator retry burden if relation checks are unstable under lighting, angle, or motion changes.
- The in-memory Web rate limiter and restricted confirmation state reset on process restart and are not substitutes for a full access-control layer.
- Access-attempt limiting slows repeated local failures but does not stop offline guessing against copied data, compromised hosts, or deliberate state rollback.
- UI tokens can be read from a compromised browser or host session.
- Passphrase policy cannot compensate for observed input, reused passwords, coercion, compromised hosts, or poor operational separation.
- Metadata checks and metadata reduction are best-effort. They can miss embedded identifiers, thumbnails, histories, and application-specific fields.
- Optional audit logs can support local review, including tamper detection for versioned records, but they also create local metadata.
- Browser history, cache, shell history, systemd logs, environment variables, and temporary files can leak operational context if the appliance is not configured carefully.
- Legacy v1/v2 retrieval has been removed. Old containers must be migrated by retrieving with an older build and storing again with this build.
- Timing normalization between the NORMAL, FAILED, and RESTRICTED recovery paths is best-effort only. The Argon2id KDF cost dominates end-to-end latency, but the RESTRICTED path includes additional filesystem writes for local-state updates that are measurable with process-level instrumentation. This difference cannot be eliminated without removing the local-state update itself. An adversary with kernel-level tracing tools can distinguish the RESTRICTED path from the FAILED path. The NORMAL and RESTRICTED paths share the same HTTP response structure and file download format; they are not distinguishable from the WebUI client's perspective.
- Response headers and download filenames for the NORMAL and RESTRICTED paths are structurally identical. Both return `retrieved_payload.bin` in `Content-Disposition` and the same media type. The `purge_applied` internal flag does not appear in any response header.

---

## Operational Guidance

- Keep `PHASMID_HOST` at the default `127.0.0.1` unless the host is otherwise protected.
- Do not expose the WebUI to an untrusted network.
- Set `PHASMID_WEB_TOKEN` explicitly for repeatable controlled sessions.
- Prefer `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET_FILE` or `PHASMID_HARDWARE_SECRET_PROMPT=1` over long-lived environment variables when adding an external device value.
- Set `PHASMID_STATE_SECRET` from removable media, a password manager, or a device value if encrypted reference templates must survive project-directory disclosure.
- Enable `PHASMID_AUDIT=1` only when an audit trail is more important than minimizing local metadata.
- Keep the configured state directory and `vault.bin` on encrypted local storage.
- For high-risk deployments, separate `vault.bin`, local state, memorized password, object cue, and optional external key material across different control conditions.
- Use `PHASMID_FIELD_MODE=1` for appliance-style deployments.
- Treat WebUI exposure control as an operational measure built from TUI-managed start/stop, default localhost binding, and inactivity auto-kill. It is not a substitute for passwords, object cues, or external values.
- Use distinct high-entropy values for normal access and restricted recovery passwords.
- Keep `PHASMID_PURGE_CONFIRMATION=1` unless the deployment explicitly accepts the data-loss risk of automatic local-state updates.
- Reinitialize the container after a panic event.
- Run the seizure review checklist before field evaluation.
- Review metadata before storing source, evidence, notes, or travel material.
- Keep only necessary data on the device and remove stale entries after the task or trip.
- Run tests before changing cryptographic or Web boundary behavior.
- If evaluating multi-object or sequence cues, require bounded runtime windows and neutral reject behavior before enabling any experimental gate by default.
