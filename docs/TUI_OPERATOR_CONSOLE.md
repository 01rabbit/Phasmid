# Phasmid TUI Operator Console

## Overview

Phasmid provides a terminal user interface as its primary operator console.

Running `phasmid` with no arguments opens the Main Operator Console. Long
command-line argument chains are not required for normal operation. Complex
workflows are accessible through the TUI, guided workflows, and configuration
files.

Phasmid is a research-grade prototype for studying and operating deniable
storage under coerced disclosure scenarios. The TUI reflects that position: it
is visually distinctive enough for hacker and security-research audiences, and
structured enough to be discussed with institutional and government-adjacent
reviewers.

## Product Position

Phasmid is presented throughout the UI as:

```text
A coercion-aware deniable-storage system.
```

Expanded:

```text
A research-grade prototype for studying and operating deniable storage
under coerced disclosure scenarios.
```

Phasmid does not claim to be production-grade, military-grade, forensic-proof,
coercion-proof, undetectable, or unbreakable. These claims are explicitly
excluded from all UI text, help output, and documentation.

## Core Terminology

### Vessel

A Vessel is a headerless deniable container file. It carries one or more
disclosure faces without exposing metadata, magic bytes, or an obvious vault
structure.

Primary UI labels:

```text
Vessels
Deniable container files
```

`Vault` is not used as the primary UI term. `Vault` implies an obvious
protected-storage object. Phasmid emphasises that the storage object does not
assert a conventional vault structure.

### Face

A Face (or Disclosure Face) is a disclosure surface within a Vessel. A Vessel
may carry multiple disclosure faces. The UI uses neutral labels and does not
identify which face is primary.

Allowed labels in the UI:

```text
Face
Disclosure Face
Face Label
Disclosure Face 1
Disclosure Face 2
```

The following terms are excluded from ordinary operation:

```text
real  /  fake  /  true  /  decoy  /  hidden truth
```

    audit.py                AuditReport, AuditSection, AuditEntry
```

Separation of concerns is enforced:

- The TUI layer handles rendering, navigation, prompts, and confirmations.
- The service layer handles use-case orchestration.
- The core layer handles cryptographic and container internals.
- The model layer holds structured data passed between services and UI.

The TUI does not implement cryptographic operations directly.

## Commands

```bash
phasmid                    Open the Main Operator Console
phasmid open <vessel>      Open a Vessel
phasmid create <vessel>    Create a new Vessel

automation and advanced use.

## Main Operator Console

The Main Operator Console is the default TUI entry point.

## WebUI Integration (Exposed Mode)

Phasmid provides a local WebUI for operators who require a graphical interface
for certain tasks. This interface is considered "exposed" as it opens a network
port (default `0.0.0.0:8000` for USB gadget-connected operation).

### WebUI Control

The WebUI can be started and stopped directly from the TUI using the `w` key.
Starting the WebUI launches a background process managed by the TUI.

### Safety Features

- **Auto-Kill Timer**: If the TUI detects no operator input for 10 minutes while
  the WebUI is active, it will automatically terminate the WebUI server to
  return the system to a stealth state.
- **Exposure Warning**: When the WebUI is active, a high-visibility warning
  banner (`⚠️ WEBUI ACTIVE (EXPOSED)`) is displayed at the top of the Home
  screen.
- **Uptime Tracking**: The Vessel Summary panel displays the current WebUI
  status and uptime when active.

### Operational Guidance

The WebUI should only be active during active use. Operators are encouraged to
use the TUI (`w`) to manually retract the WebUI as soon as the graphical task
is complete.

## ASCII Banner

`src/phasmid/tui/banner.py` provides centralised banner support.

```python
FULL_BANNER: str      # full multi-line ASCII art banner
COMPACT_BANNER: str   # compact text fallback
BANNER_FULL_MIN_WIDTH = 90

def get_banner(width: int, compact: bool = False) -> str:
    ...
```

Behaviour:

- Terminal width ≥ 90 and `compact=False`: returns `FULL_BANNER`.
- Terminal width < 90 or `compact=True`: returns `COMPACT_BANNER`.
- The full banner is shown only on the About / splash screen.
- It is not shown on every workflow screen.

Full banner:

```text
       ____  __
      / __ \/ /_  ____ __________ ___  (_)____/ /
     / /_/ / __ \/ __ `/ ___/ __ `__ \/ / ___/ /
    / ____/ / / / /_/ (__  ) / / / / / / /  /_/
   /_/   /_/ /_/\__,_/____/_/ /_/ /_/_/_/  (_)

        Janus Eidolon System
        coercion-aware deniable storage

        one vessel / multiple faces / no confession
```

Compact banner:

```text
PHASMID
JANUS EIDOLON SYSTEM

coercion-aware deniable storage
one vessel / multiple faces / no confession
```

## Vessel Discovery and Registration

Known Vessels are sourced from:

- registered Vessel paths (stored in `vessel_registry.json` in the config dir)
- the default Vessel directory configured in settings
- manually selected files

The registry stores only non-secret metadata (file paths). It never stores
passphrases, derived keys, raw keys, object keys, recovery secrets, or file
contents.

Paths in the UI may be redacted. A long path such as:

```text
/Users/alice/Documents/travel/notes/field.vessel
```

is displayed as:

```text
~/Documents/.../field.vessel
```

## Inspection

The inspection service (`services/inspection_service.py`) analyses a file
without decrypting it.

Output fields:

```text
File              path to the file
Size              human-readable size
Header            no recognized header detected
Magic Bytes       no obvious magic bytes detected  (or detected type)
Entropy           high / random-like  (with bits/byte value)
Recognized Type   unknown  (or identified type)
Vessel Claim      not asserted
```

Cautious language is used throughout. The inspection result never asserts that
a file is deniable or undetectable. It reports what was observed.

## Doctor View

The doctor service (`services/doctor_service.py`) runs structured local
environment checks and returns a `DoctorResult` with a list of `DoctorCheck`
entries, each with a level of `OK`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, or `INFO`.

Checks performed:

| Check | Notes |
|---|---|
| Configuration directory permissions | Warns if accessible to other users |
| Profile directory permissions | Warns if accessible to other users |
| Temporary directory policy | Warns if world-writable |
| Output directory permissions | Checked when an output dir is configured |
| Secure randomness | Verifies `secrets.token_bytes` is available |
| Shell history | Warns if `HISTFILE` is set |
| Swap status | Best effort; Linux only |
| Terminal scrollback | Info notice only |
| Debug logging | Warns if `PHASMID_DEBUG` is set |

Required disclaimer shown at the end of every Doctor run:

```text
This check reduces obvious mistakes. It does not certify the host as secure.
```

## Audit View

The audit service (`services/audit_service.py`) generates a static
`AuditReport` with the following sections:

- **System Position** — status, purpose, scope, non-claims
- **Cryptographic Controls** — AEAD, KDF, header, magic bytes, metadata
- **Operational Controls** — config secrets, passphrase logging, destructive confirm
- **Logging Policy** — what is and is not logged, path redaction
- **Known Limitations** — host compromise, OS artifacts, coercion resistance
- **Non-Claims** — explicit list of things Phasmid does not claim

The Audit View is intended to make Phasmid credible to security researchers,
government-adjacent evaluators, and institutional reviewers.

## Guided Workflows

Guided Workflows are step-by-step interactive explanations built into the same
operator console. They are not a separate demo mode.

Available workflows:

| ID | Title |
|---|---|
| `coerced_disclosure` | Coerced Disclosure Walkthrough |
| `headerless_inspection` | Headerless Vessel Inspection |
| `multiple_faces` | Multiple Disclosure Faces |
| `safety_checklist` | Operator Safety Checklist |

Each workflow shows a description and numbered steps. Steps use only permitted
terminology and avoid forbidden terms.

## Configuration and Profiles

Configuration is stored in the OS-native user config directory, resolved
through `platformdirs.user_config_dir("phasmid")`.

Typical locations:

```text
macOS:  ~/Library/Application Support/phasmid/
Linux:  ~/.config/phasmid/
```

Profiles are stored as TOML files under `profiles/`. Profile files are
created with mode `0600`. The config directory is created with mode `0700`.

Allowed profile fields:

```text
name                  profile name
container_size        default container size (e.g. "512M")
default_vessel_dir    default Vessel directory
default_output        default output directory
recent_tracking       whether to track recently opened Vessels
kdf_profile           KDF preset name (e.g. "interactive")
theme                 UI theme ("dark" or "light")
compact_banner        force compact banner regardless of terminal width
```

Profiles must not contain passphrases, derived keys, raw key material, object
keys, or recovery secrets. The `Profile` model enforces this with a
`FORBIDDEN_KEYS` check and a `has_secrets()` guard. Attempting to save a
profile with a forbidden field raises a `ValueError`.

## Logging and Redaction

The following are never logged:

- passphrases
- derived keys
- raw key material
- object keys
- recovery phrases
- file contents

`vessel_service.redact_path()` reduces full paths before they appear in log
output or UI notifications. Paths with more than three components relative to
the home directory are shortened to `~/first/.../filename`.

## Confirmation Rules

The following actions require explicit confirmation before proceeding:

```text
Overwrite an existing Vessel file
Overwrite extracted output
Delete a Vessel registration
Remove a Face label
Clear recent history
Reset local generated assets
```

High-impact actions require the user to type `CONFIRM` before proceeding. The
confirmation prompt is plain and professional. Theatrical phrases are not used
for safety-critical operations.

## Error Handling

Errors are actionable. Example format:

```text
Could not open Vessel.
Reason: file does not exist.
Next step: choose another path or create a new Vessel.
```

Python tracebacks are not shown in normal TUI usage. They are visible only when
`PHASMID_DEBUG=1` is set.

## Terminal Requirements

Minimum supported terminal size: 100 columns × 30 rows.

Required navigation:

```text
Arrow keys   selection
Enter        activate
Esc          go back / dismiss
q            quit
?            help
```

Mouse support is optional.

## Security Claim Discipline

Allowed wording in all UI text, help output, and documentation:

```text
headerless
deniable
random-like
no obvious metadata
no recognized header detected
plausible disclosure
coerced disclosure
research-grade prototype
coercion-aware
```

Excluded wording:

```text
undetectable
unbreakable
forensic-proof
coercion-proof
military-grade
guaranteed safe
impossible to discover
production-grade
```

## Known Limitations

- Host compromise may defeat confidentiality.
- OS artifacts (swap, logs, filesystem metadata) may reveal usage.
- Coercion resistance is procedural, not absolute.
- Deniability depends on operational context, not only on technical design.
- Side channels are not systematically addressed.
- Memory forensics is not addressed.

These limitations are displayed verbatim in the Audit View.

## Intended Balance

Phasmid is designed to be:

```text
Distinctive enough to attract hackers.
Practical enough to operate.
Careful enough to avoid false security claims.
Structured enough for serious institutional review.
```
